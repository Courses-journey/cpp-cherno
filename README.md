# How C++ Works

## Some

- `#include <iostream>`

  - preprossecer statement it means this statement will be processed first before compilation
  - `include <iostream>` it will look for file called `iostream` and paste it the file u called in

- `<<`

  - Overloaded operator
  - operator are just functions

- `int main()`

  - sepcial case it assume it return `0`

- `cin.get()`

  - await user press enter before programe end

- **After compilation finish there will be `.obj` file for all `.cpp` files**

## Declaration and Definition

- Declaration is the header of function like

```c++
void log(const char* message);
```

- Definition is the implementation of Declaration
  - or declaration with body

```c++
void log(const char* message)
{
  std::cout<<message<<std::endl;
}
```

- U can ignore param name in Declaration for example

```c++
void log(const char*);
```

# How the C++ Compiler Works

- Steps

  - Compiling
  - Linking

## Compiling

- Take text file and convert it to intermediate file called `obj`

- Steps

  - All preprocessors statement evaluated first
  - tokenizing and parsing
  - Abstract syntax tree
  - All of the code must be at the end either constatnt data or instruction

- `cpp` files are called translation units
- cpp dosenot care about files
- files have no meaning
- Not nessecary that num `.cpp` files equal translation units
  - u may make some `.cpp` files but include all these file in one `.cpp`

## Pre-processing Statements

- `include`
  - include look for file u want open it and read all its data and then copy it to file u call it form
- `define`
  - take the name follwing it and replace it with whatever follows
- `if` `endif`
  - use to include or exclude code based on given condition
- `ifdef`
- `pragma`

# How the C++ Linker Works

## what does?

- Linker find where each symbols and function is and link them together

## TO KNOW

- WHEN compile file in vs only compilation stage happen
- WHEN build or run the project both the stage happen compilation then linking

## Errors

- `error: C0000` mean it's a compilation error.
- `error: LNK0000` mean it's a linking error.

## T

- Declared function won't be compiled or linked utill you call them in your code
- Function definition will compiled and linked even if u never call them as they could be used in another file
- If u define function by word `static` this mean that function only used in the translation unit u defined into

## Avoid linking errors

- `static`

  - all files will have its own version of function

- `inline`

  - will replace call with the function body

- Move to third translation unit
