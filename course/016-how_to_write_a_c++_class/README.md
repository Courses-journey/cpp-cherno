# How to Write a C++ Class


- use `m_` with private variable in class
  - stand for member variable
  - it just a better way to get the member of class
- Separate public function from public variable from public static variable

```c++
class Foo
{
  public:
    // static variables

  public:
    // variables

  public:
    // functions
}
```
